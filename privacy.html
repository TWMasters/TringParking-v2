      <p>
        All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you
        must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
      </p>
      <h4>Information automatically collected</h4>
      <p><i>
        <strong>In Short:</strong>
        Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and
        device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Website.
      </i></p>
      <p>
        I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Website. This
        information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but

        characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country,
        location, information about how and when you use our Website and other technical information.
        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and
        for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many businesses, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.
      </p>

          which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information I collect depends on the
          type and settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, I may use
          GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location
          (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information
          either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your
          device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects
          of the Services.
