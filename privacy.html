      </p>
      <h4>Information automatically collected</h4>

        characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country,
        location, information about how and when you use our Website and other technical information.
        This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website, and

        In the United Kingdom you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may
        include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to
        request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and
        (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to
        object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the
        <a href="#section-13">contact details</a>
        provided below. I will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
        applicable data protection laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to
        withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of
        the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information
        conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        If you are a resident in the United Kingdom and you believe I are unlawfully processing your
        personal information, you also have the right to complain to the Information Commissioners
        Office. Their contact details are:

      <h3 id="section-11">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-
        Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
        have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform
        technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such,
        I do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
        that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
        privacy notice.

      <h3 id="section-12">12. DO I MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>

        Yes, I will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
      </i></p>
      <p>
        I may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
        updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If I
        make material changes to this privacy notice, I may notify you either by prominently posting a
        notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. I encourage you to review this
        privacy notice frequently to be informed of how I are protecting your information.
